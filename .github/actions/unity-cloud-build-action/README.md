# Action

This action allows to build your Unity project on Unity Cloud Build as a Github-action. Generally, this should be much faster than running the build-process on Github servers.

# Usage

See for a usage example this file: https://github.com/ElmarJ/Waterlooplein3D/blob/main/.github/workflows/cloud-build-action.yml
